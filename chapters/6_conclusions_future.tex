Non trivial cuts (notebooks about how to find convex intersection, etc.)

One can more or less devise an strategy if a single attribute is cut with a simple
less than or/and greater than (right?) but what if the thing is more complicated,
like SNR?

Dig out the notebooks, put them nicely here. Open question, might be cool.

Some of the points mentioned in EDD paper:

* Correlation matrices
* Dimensionality reduction
* No direct EDD (i.e. SNR filtering) Link this with convex checks somehow, I guess?
* How to identify files cut among a given attribute? i.e. coordinate X
